## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-bot-starter.git
cd telegram-bot-starter


> **💡 P.S.** If you're using **PyCharm**, you need to create an **environment variable (Environment Variable)** for your bot token.  

Follow these steps:
1. Open **PyCharm**. In the top-right corner, locate your main Python file (e.g., `main.py`).  
2. Click the small arrow next to it and select **"Edit Configurations"**.  
3. Find the section called **"Environment Variables"** and click **"+"** to add a new one.  
4. Add the following variable:  
   - **Name:** `BOT_TOKEN`  
   - **Value:** Your bot token (you can get it from **[BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)** on Telegram).  

✅ Done! Now your bot will automatically read the token from the environment variable when you run it in PyCharm.
